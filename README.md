# Ck3CommunityMod-1
The First Community Mod for Ck3
Community Mods are 100% open source, all modders can equally participate no matter your skill level, just remember this is all for fun.
Each addition will be overviewed. Feel free to add new features and edit old ones.
# The Theme
Each mod has a loose theme to get ideas flowing, every addition is not forced to be related to the theme.
The Theme for the first Ck3 Community Mod is "Communities"
# Basic Rules
Community Mods can become Total Conversion mods if the community works for that goal, but they dont all have to be.
If you change the year of the start date suddenly in the middle of the modding process you will be denied, the maximum amount of time to change the year the mod takes place is the first week of modding.
We encourage modders to add new start dates using the bookmarks instead of changing already existing bookmarks, and to stay in the agreed upon era of the mod.
And most of all, dont be a jerk.
